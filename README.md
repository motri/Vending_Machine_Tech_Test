## Vending Machine Tech Test
The aim of this tech test is to emulate the behavior of a vending machine.

In this case the machine only takes 50 pence coins, only sells water(60p) and crisps(40p) and returns the right amount of change owed plus the list of "bought" items.
This program was written to be interacted with through the command line.
